# 1.Kilometer Converter
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then
# convert that distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:
# Miles = Kilometers * 0.6214

def kilo_converter():
    kilo_distance = float(input("Please enter the distance in kilometers: "))
    miles  = kilo_distance* .6214
    print(f"{kilo_distance} in miles is {miles:.2f}")

# 2.How Much Insurance?
# Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or
# buildings for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the
# structure. Write a program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a
# building and then displays the minimum amount of insurance he or she should
# buy for the property.

def insurance_min():
    cost = float(input(" Please enter the replacement cost of the building: "))
    insurance = cost * .8
    print(f"The minimum amount or insurance for this property should be {insurance:.2f}")

# 3. Stadium Seating
# There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A seats
# cost $20, Class B seats cost $15, and Class C seats cost $10. Write a program that
# asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold, and then displays the
# amount of income generated from each class of ticket and total ticket sales

    classA = int(input("How many Class A tickets were sold? ")) * 20
    classB = int(input("How many Class B tickets were sold? ")) * 15

    revenue = classA + classB + classC
    print(f"Class A sales: ${classA:.2f} ; Class B sales: ${classB:.2f} ; 8Class C sales: ${classC:.2f}")
    print(f"The total income generated from total tickets is ${revenue:.2f}")
