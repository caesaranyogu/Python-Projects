# Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a
# period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the
# second day, and continues to double each day. The program should ask the user
# for the number of days. Display a table showing what the salary was for each day,
# and then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be
# displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies.

# Define variables
pennies = 1
day = 1
days = int(input("Enter the number of days please? "))

# Write while loop
while day <= days:
    dollars = pennies/100
    print(f"On day {day}\t You have ${dollars}")
    pennies = pennies *2
    day += 1
print(f"The final number of dollars is {dollars}")
